							~~~PROJECT: SUBGATEUNIVERSE~~~

	*** REMARK ***

This is my first project in game development. I will use C in combination with OpenGL and some helper libraries like glut and glew.

Use the following commands to build the project:

make all		# build all applications
make su			# build client application
make sud		# build server application
make packet		# build server testing tool

I am on linux and i use gcc. If you are on another platform or using a different compiler, then you might have to make changes to the makefile.
