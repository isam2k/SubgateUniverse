*~								~~~PROJECT: SUBGATE UNIVERSE~~~
*~
**** REMARK ****************************************************************************************
*~
*~	This is my first project in game development. I will use C in combination with OpenGL and some
*~	helper libraries like glut and glew.
*~	
*~	Use the following commands to build the project:
*~	
*~		make all		# build all applications
*~		make su			# build client application
*~		make sud		# build server application
*~		make packet		# build server testing tool
*~
*~	I personally use gcc. If you are using a different compiler, then you might have to make changes
*~	in the makefile.
*~	
*~	All source files for subgate and sud are located in the src directory. Code files with a 'su_'
*~	prefix are related to subgate (the client application) and those with the 'sud_' prefix are
*~	related to sud.
*~	
**** DESCRIPTION ***********************************************************************************
*~	
*~	Subgate Universe is a project with several applications, a client, a server, and some testing
*~	applications. Basically what i want to realize is a multiplayer space shooter with 3D graphics.
*~	
**** APPLICATIONS **********************************************************************************
*~	
*~	Name: subgate
*~	
*~	Description: This is the client program, the graphical interface so to speak.
*~	
****************************************************************************************************
*~	
*~	Name: sud
*~	
*~	Description: The server application. It uses connectionless datagram socket connection.
*~	
*~	Usage: ./sud [options]
*~	
*~	All options are optional, if no argument is given then the server uses the following default
*~	configuration:
*~	
*~		Port:		6249
*~		Logfile:	sud.log
*~		Players:	4
*~	
*~	All these settings can be changed by passing the following command line arguments when starting
*~	the application:
*~	
*~		-p PORT		# change default port to PORT
*~		-l LOGFILE	# change default logfile to LOGFILE
*~		-m MAXCONN	# allow MAXCONN players to be connected simultaniously
*~	
*~	Whenever one of these arguments is invalid then the default configuration will take place.
*~	
****************************************************************************************************
*~	
*~	Name: packet
*~	
*~	Description: A testing tool to monitor sud's behaviour when recieving and handling packets.
*~	
*~	Remark: This tool can only be used to test sud in its default configuration state. Only local
*~	connections are allowed.
*~	
**** GOALS *****************************************************************************************
*~	
*~	-	SDL
*~	+	GLUT
*~	+	Shaders and textures
*~	*	Better loader function for .mtl and .obj files
*~	
*~	
*~	(-) : Remove
*~	(+) : Add
*~	(*) : Change
*~	
**** CHANGELOG *************************************************************************************
*~	
*~	21.11.2010	:	Server is now able to distribute recieved packets to its connected clients.
*~	13.11.2010	:	Changed code structure for better flexibility. Updated makefile.
